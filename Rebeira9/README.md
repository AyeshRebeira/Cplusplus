Assignment 9


This is a C++ program for assignment 9. The purpose of this program is to convert the infix expression to postfix then evaluate the postfix expression.
This is a copy of Assignment 1 with a difference in the implementation. This program uses a tree, and polymorphism, instead of stacks and queues.

Included are: main.cpp, token.cpp, stackType.h, queueType.h, token.h


TO RUN
First type make clean to remove all the .o files and prog. Then type make. Follow the procedure below to compile and run the program.

Step1: make clean

Step2: make

Step3: type ls to see if all the .o files and prog were created. If they exist it means the program works. Then proceed to Step4.

Step4: type prog to run the program.

If the program successfully runs:

- You will receive a message to screen asking to enter a valid arithmetic expression on one line.
- Then try to enter: 1+(2*3) or you can use your own number.
- The program will then evaluate the infix to postfix expression for you.
