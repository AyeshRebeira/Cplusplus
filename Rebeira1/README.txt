C++ program for assignment 1. The purpose of this program is to convert the infix expression to postfix then evaluate the postfix expression.

To make this possible, I used three different files of which two were provided by the instructor. 

The project includes: main.cpp, stackType.h, queueType.h, token.h 

TO RUN First type make clean to remove all the .o files and prog. Then type make. Follow the procedure below to compile and run the program.

Step1: make clean

Step2: make

Step3: type ls to see if all the .o files and prog were created. If they exist it means the program works. Then proceed to Step4.

Step4: type prog to run the program.

If the program successfully runs:

You will receive a message to screen asking to enter a valid arithmetic expression on one line.
Then try to enter: 1+(2*3) or you can use your own number.
The program will then evaluate the infix to postfix expression for you.
